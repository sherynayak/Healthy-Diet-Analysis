# Healthy-diet-Analysis and deployment in flask
Proper nutrition and hydration are vital. People who eat a well-balanced diet tend to be healthier with stronger immune systems and lower risk of infectious diseases. Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms. However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles has led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains. The USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion recommends a very simple daily diet intake guideline: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10% fruits, and 20% protein. This project aims in classifying a perfect balanced diet and predict the percentage level of recovery cases of Covidâ€™19 affected people. We use different methodologies like regression and classification analysis.

Problem Statement:

To predict the diet is healthy or not based on the percentages of fat consumed from each type of food listed and as per the Research of USDA.
